# fruits and vegetables
## introduction

Most nutritional and global recommendations include consumption of at least 2 servings of fruits and 3 servings of vegetables per day for adults. 
More than 100 countries worldwide have developed food-based dietary guidelines adapted to their nutrition situation, food availability, culinary cultures, and eating habits that encourage increased F&V consumption.
Diets high in fruits and vegetables (F&V) are widely recommended in developed countries for their health-promoting properties
They have historically held a place in dietary guidance because of their vitamin, mineral, dietary fiber, and, more recently, dietary bioactive content.

## Effect of fruit and vegetable intakes on all-cause mortality

The most recent systematic review and meta-analysis found that with increasing intake, the risk of all-cause mortality decreased for fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and fish.
Optimal consumption of risk-decreasing foods resulted in a 56% reduction in all-cause mortality.
However, these investigated food groups are often only part of healthy dietary patterns. 
High adherence to the HEI and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diets has been associated with a 22% lower risk of all-cause mortality. 



## Increasing fruit and vegetable consumption



F&V are colourful, flavourful, and nutritious components of the diet and are often most attractive when harvested at their peak maturity. 
However, most F&V grow only in certain parts of the world, under specific environmental conditions, and at particular times throughout the year. 
They also typically contain >90% water and once harvested begin to undergo higher rates of respiration that results in moisture loss, quality deterioration, and potential microbial spoilage. 
Storage and processing technologies, such as freezing, canning, drying, and juicing, all serve to transform perishable produce into products that can be consumed year-round.
Processed products such as canned goods may contribute to increased sodium intakes; however, draining brine and/or rinsing vegetables and legumes reduces their sodium content in addition to other water-soluble nutrients like vitamin C.

## Conclusions
Strong accumulating evidence demonstrates that habitual consumption of F&V, primarily of the non-starchy variety, has health-promoting properties that extend beyond helping individuals obtain essential nutrient requirements.
 Authoritative bodies have long recommended consumption of F&V because of their low energy density, high nutrient density, and dietary fibre content.
 In addition to essential nutrients, it is well established that F&V contain a diverse array of dietary bioactive compounds that provide human health benefits beyond basic nutrition in addition to their essential nutrients. 
The majority of evidence linking F&V intake to health promotion and chronic disease prevention is observational and cannot be used to establish causality.
